# Tower of Hanoi Puzzle

# Step 1

# In this project, you will solve the mathematical puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi. 
# The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.

# The goal of this puzzle is moving the disks from the first rod to the third rod, following specific 
# rules that restrict placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one.

# Start by creating an empty dictionary named rods to represent the rods.

rods = {}

# Step 2

# The rods dictionary will represent the three rods with their disks. 
# Give it the strings 'A', 'B', and 'C' as keys and set each of them to an empty list.

rods = {'A': [], 'B': [], 'C': []}
